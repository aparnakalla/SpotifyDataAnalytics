# Music Streaming Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of my personal music streaming data from Spotify, covering the period from April 2023 to April 2024. By analyzing this data, the project uncovers insights into my listening habits, favorite artists and tracks, session patterns, and temporal trends. The analysis leverages Python for data processing, visualization, and clustering to better understand listening behaviors.


## Project Overview
This project analyzes personal music streaming data to:
- Identify top artists and tracks by listening time.
- Analyze listening sessions, including session duration and popular tracks/artists in long sessions.
- Explore temporal listening trends (e.g., daily, weekly patterns) and changes over time.
- Use clustering to group similar listening patterns.
